            <h2>About The Yellowstone Supervolcano</h2>
            <p>Yellowstone Supervolcano, located primarily in the U.S. state of Wyoming, is one of the largest active volcanic systems in the world. Yellowstone also averages between 1,000 and 3,000 earthquakes a year. Most are virtually unnoticeable, with a magnitude of three or less. </p>

            <h2>Recent Eruption</h2>
            <p>The most recent major eruption of Yellowstone occurred approximately 640,000 years ago. 		Since then, there have been smaller volcanic events and geothermal activity in the area.</p>

            <h2>Next Eruption Prediction</h2>
            <p>Scientists continuously monitor Yellowstone for signs of potential eruptions. “There is no current activity that is going on that would indicate anything is happening. If there was something coming, there is nothing to show at this point in time,” says Dr. Jacob Lowenstern, research geologist and Scientist-in-Charge at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory.
