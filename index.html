            <h2>Volcanic Eruption Predictions</h2>
            <p>Forecasts of volcanic eruptions are based on many different things, mainly seismic activity and then then previous activity. However, the predictions are notoriously unreliable for two reasons: 1) few volcanoes are sufficiently well studied to provide an accurate eruptive history over the many hundreds, or tens of thousands, of years necessary to establish a reliable recurrence interval; and 2) few volcanoes maintain the same behavior for long (more often than not, as soon as a repetitive pattern becomes apparent, the volcano changes behavior).
