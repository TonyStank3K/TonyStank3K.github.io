            <h2>About the Hawaiian Islands</h2>
            <p>The oldest of these islands, Kauai, was formed a mere 5 million years ago. From this picture, you can see that the Hawaiian islands are formed by a hotspot in the mantle that makes a volcano and has many islands due to the crest shifting slowly. There are 3 active volcanoes in the
islands including the world’s largest active volcano, Mauna Loa which erupted in November 2022 after being quiet for the past four decades.

            <h2>Island Creation</h2>
            <p>Kilauea, Hawaii’s youngest volcano on Hawaii’s Big Island, formed underwater around 280,000 years ago, according to the National Park Service. The next island to be created is located roughly 22 miles off the southern coast of the Big Island and is named Loihi. However, Loihi is not an island yet because it is still roughly 3,280 feet below sea level despite already having risen by over
10,000 feet. As lava continues to be deposited on Loihi, scientists predict that it will rise above sea level sometime between 10,000 and 100,000 years from now.</p>

            <h2>Most Recent Eruption</h2>
            <p>Kilauea was erupting at the summit most recently from September 10-16, 2023 and is the most active volcano on Earth. Kilauea has erupted almost continuously from 1983 until 2018, when a months-long eruption created slow-moving lava flows that destroyed around 700 homes. Since the 2018 eruption, Kilauea has been erupting sporadically. These recent eruptions have been contained within the Halema‘uma‘u crater as lakes of lava.
